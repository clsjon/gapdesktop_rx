Gapminder has certain license rights in order to provide you with access to the Trendalyzer Package through this website.  In some cases, Gapminder may offer access to the Package on a CD-ROM or similar physical medium; references to website access to the Trendalyzer Package in these Terms of Service shall be understood to include alternate methods of access (such as on a physical medium like a CD-ROM).   The same Terms of Service apply regardless of your method of accessing the Package. </span></p><p><span>Gapminder make the Trendalyzer Package available, along with the Data Provider’s statistical information included with this version of the Package, solely for your non-commercial, educational, or informational use through Gapminder’s website or by the alternate method of access offered (in either case, the “Website”). By using or accessing the Package through the Website, you agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Service.  If any of these terms are unacceptable to you, you should stop all use of the Trendalyzer Package and not access the Trendalyzer portion of the Website until agreement has been reached between you and Gapminder (or its licensee) as to the applicable Terms of Service. The terms "you" and "User" refer to anyone who accesses the Trendalyzer Package through the Website.</span></p><p></p><p><span>Gapminder may change these Terms of Service at any time without notice. Changes will be posted under "Terms of Service.”  Your use of the Package or the Website after any changes have been posted will constitute your agreement to the modified Terms of Service and all of the changes.
